## Definition

Inspired by the idea of a software development life cycle, a technique used within tech to develop new software. My development life cycle, MDLC; is an experimental iterative life cycle of my development. Defined in 6 steps:

### Define

*“Map the route”*

Do not just blindly push forward, give yourself a direction.

### Explore

*“Get out there, and loot”*

Push towards your goal, see what you find.

### Reflect

*“Organize the loot”*

Parse through what you had found, find what’s useful and what’s not.

### Create

*“Build something with the loot”*

See what you can make with your new findings.

### Share

*“Put what you built out there”*

Show your future self what you made.

### Reset

*“Clear the inventory”*

Move on, prepare for the next journey.
