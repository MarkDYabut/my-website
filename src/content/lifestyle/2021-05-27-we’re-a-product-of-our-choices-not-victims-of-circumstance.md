### Quote from Can't hurt me - David Goggins

> "Nobody likes to hear the hard truth. Individually and as a culture, we avoid what we need to hear most. This world is fucked up, there are major problems in our society. We are still dividing ourselves up along racial and cultural lines, and people don't have the balls to hear it! The truth is racism and bigotry still fucking exist and some people are so thin-skinned they refuse to admit that."
>
> "But if you are the only, and you aren't stuck in some real-world genocidal twilight zone, you'd better get real too. Your life is not fucked up because of overt racists or hidden systemic racism. You aren't missing out on opportunities, making shit money, and getting evicted because of America or Donald fucking Trump or because your ancestors were slaves or because some people hate immigrants or Jews or harass women or believe gay people are going to hell. If any of that shit is stopping you from excelling in life, I've got some news. *You are stopping you."*

### Circumstance

We all live within some sort of circumstance with varying severities. The idea is to not allow these circumstances to define us, but to instead let our choices define us.

### Adversity

We have the opportunity to overcome adversity. When we experience adversity, it's up to us to decide how to respond. We can choose to allow it to define us or we can choose to make it a defining moment.

### Attitude

Regardless of how bad our situations are, we always have a choice to either get back up or stay down.

There is much in life that we cannot control; we can however, control our attitude. We were all put on this earth because we're strong enough to live through it, so don't waste time insisting that life isn't fair. Life is not supposed to be fair, we're supposed to learn how to live with it.
