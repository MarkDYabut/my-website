It is a frightening thought that man also has a shadow side to him, consisting not just of little weaknesses and foibles, but of a positively demonic dynamism.

Modern man is sick because he is not whole.

Wholeness is not achieved by cutting off a portion of one's being, but by integration of the contraries.

The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely.

Assertiveness is one way to further integrate your shadow.

Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.

One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.

Consult your resentment. It's a revelatory emotion. Resentment always means of one of two things. Either the resentful person is immature, in which case he or she should shut up, quit whining, and get on with it. Or is being taken advantage of (or allowing yourself to be taken advantage of).

In each of us there is another whom we do not know.

Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness's of other people

What you resist, persists.

If you are resisting something, you are feeding it. Any energy you fight, you are feeding. If you are pushing something away, you are inviting it to stay.
