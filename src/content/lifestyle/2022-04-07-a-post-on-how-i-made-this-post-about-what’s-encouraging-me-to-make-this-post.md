For this one i’m going to go backwards and first address the idea of **what’s encouraging me to make this post** and then talk about **how I made this post.**

## What’s encouraging me to make this post

There’s been a lot of encouragement over the last few years (since I made this place), but as usual with most habits we all try to build; they do not last. That is *okay* though. I look back at my older posts and i’m glad that I at least tried; the fact that i’m trying again is the most important part for me. There really is beauty in the struggle; I think the key to success is getting use to being on our asses, and constantly *trying again*.

> Life is about living and not conceptualizing

Going to steal this quote that’s been stuck in my head. Though i’d argue it does not even embody my message but I will force it into relevancy with the hope it gets out of my head. When I think about life, I think about what is important. So if this place is important to me, instead of just conceptualizing what I should or should-not post on here, i’m just going to not think too far ahead and just do it.

## How I made this post

Going to talk more about process here, rather than all that self-help-growth stuff I just tried to articulate above.

I’ve raved quite a bit about using Notion, but in essence; it is where I store my ideas and it is where I also create these posts (initially). After typing them out i’ll simply insert whatever assets I need; all my drawings are done through another web application called Excalidraw.

After I’ve created the assets; I will head over to the CMS of my website and copy and paste it in.

And then 'Publlish' which will start my CI/CD pipeline which you can read more about in the tech post I wrote about it.
